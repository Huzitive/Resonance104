      <h2>What is Resonance?</h2>
      <p>
        Resonance is a phenomenon where a system oscillates with greater amplitude at certain frequencies, known as its natural frequency.
        When an external periodic force matches this frequency, the system absorbs more energy and begins to oscillate more intensely.
        This is observed in many systems — musical instruments, bridges, glass — where matching frequencies can lead to powerful effects.

      <h2>1. Tuning Fork and Pinball (Amplification)</h2>
      <p>
        This animation demonstrates how resonance can transfer energy from one tuning fork to another of the same natural frequency,
        causing motion in a suspended pinball. It illustrates the principle of amplification through resonance.

      <h2>2. Bridge Oscillation: Tacoma Narrows</h2>
      <p>
        A historical example of destructive resonance. This animation simulates the effect of wind resonating with the natural frequency
        of a suspension bridge (like the Tacoma Narrows), eventually leading to its collapse.

      <h2>3. Shattering Glass with Sound</h2>
      <p>
        Sound waves matching the resonant frequency of a wine glass cause it to vibrate more and more until it shatters. This animation
        visually shows how seemingly invisible waves can cause visible destruction — a dramatic representation of resonance.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Resonance has practical implications in engineering, music, medicine (MRI), and even earthquakes. Understanding resonance helps
        design safer structures and harness energy in controlled ways.
