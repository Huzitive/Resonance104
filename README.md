# 🌉 Resonance Project — Visualizing the Beauty and Danger of Natural Frequencies

Welcome to the **Resonance Project**, an interactive and visual journey into the world of **mechanical resonance**. This project brings to life the science behind some of the most fascinating (and destructive) phenomena in physics — from the swaying of suspension bridges to the shattering of a wine glass by pure sound.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To **educate and engage** students, teachers, and physics enthusiasts by creating **realistic, interactive simulations** of resonance in action — using only web technologies and light code.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **🌉 Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse**  
  A wind-induced resonance demo that visually explains the bridge's destruction.

- **🎵 Glass Shattering by Sound**  
  Watch sound waves cause a wine glass to vibrate, resonate, and ultimately break.

- **🧱 Mass-Spring Earthquake Resonator**  
  Simulate how different buildings respond to ground motion and resonance.

- **Interactive Elements**  
  Control frequency and amplitude in simulations.  
  Visualize how different structures behave at their resonant frequencies.

- **Beautifully Crafted Website**  
  Smooth animations and a clean UI for a distraction-free experience.  
  Linked pages for each simulation.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** — Frontend core  
- **p5.js / JS Canvas** — For smooth, physics-based animations  
- **Matplotlib (Python)** — For interactive graph visualization (exported as standalone HTML)  
- **Git & GitHub** — Version control and collaboration

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resonance-project.git
   cd resonance-project
    Open the website:

        Launch index.html in your browser.

        Navigate through the simulations from the homepage.

    (Optional) View the Python-generated interactive graph:

        Open resonance_graph.html separately in your browser.

📚 Learn More

Each simulation includes a short description of the underlying physics to help users see and understand how resonance works.

Perfect for:

    High school and university presentations

    Self-study and exploration

    Physics club exhibitions
